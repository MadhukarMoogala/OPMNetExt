## Motivation

AutoCAD's Properties Palette - once known as the Object Properties Manager (OPM) - is a very handy
way to display properties inside your application, whether those properties are associated with 
individual objects or with the application itself. The Properties Palette uses COM to communicate 
with the object(s) in question, and has always required the use of C++ to expose particular interfaces 
that control the display of the properties in the palette, so its functionality has not been available 
to developers using managed .NET languages such as C# and VB.NET.
There is some portion of the Properties Palette functionality exposed via the 
Autodesk.AutoCAD.Windows.ToolPalette namespace, such as the IAcPiPropertyDisplay interface allowing 
objects and commands to customize the display of properties in the property inspector window, but 
this is far from complete. This library looks at exposing more of the standard Properties Palette 
functionality to .NET languages.
